!!Flag diacritics
We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
 | @P.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @D.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @C.NeedNoun@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised

For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
do no harm.
 | @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 | @D.CmpPref.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 | @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
 | @D.CmpLast.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering R
 | @D.CmpNone.TRUE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 | @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 | @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 | @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.

Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
given the proper use of these flags.
 | @U.Cap.Obl@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 | @U.Cap.Opt@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.





!!!Lexicon ENDLEX
And this is the ENDLEX of everything:
{{{
 @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@@D.CmpPref.TRUE@@D.NeedNoun.ON@ # ;
}}}
The {{@D.CmpOnly.FALSE@}} flag diacritic is ued to disallow words tagged
with +CmpN/Only to end here.
The {{@D.NeedNoun.ON@}} flag diacritic is used to block illegal compounds.
